Webscraping!
------------

Sorry, I'm not a huge fan of jupyter notebook, so I went ahead and just wrote 
a normal python file.

I built a pretty basic daily website. It gives you the weather, some news 
headlines, an inspirational quote, and some stocks you're following, all in a 
simple format. To do so, I used BeautifulSoup to write the output HTML too.

`template.html` is an empty template that is filled out by BeautifulSoup. `name` 
is a text file containing the name of who will be greeted.
